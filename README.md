# Digit-Recognition
A Graphical User Interface for digit (numbers: 0, 1, 2, ... , 8, 9) recognition using a Neural Network

This is an application for Neural Networks that I recently created.
The Neural Network can be easily adapted to recognize patterns and to make classifications in any kind of data sets.
I chose digit recognition because it has a great visual impact to see the Neural Network at work

All you have to do is draw a digit with the mouse on the "Drawing Board" - press "Read" and the algorithm will recognize the figure drawn by you. Press "Next" and start over.

### Disclaimer:
The algorithm is designed to return a digit (numbers: 0, 1, 2, ... , 8, 9) regardless of what is drawn on the "Drawing Board", so any drawing that does not resemble a digit, or is a very distorted digit, will generate an unpredictable result.

The algorithm has approximately 95% accuracy, so sometimes it returns wrong answers. To avoid this effect, make sure that the drawn figure occupies a large area of the "Drawing Board" and is centered.
